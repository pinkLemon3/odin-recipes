    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian comfort food made by layering pasta sheets with
        rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese. Baked to golden perfection,
        it's hearty, flavorful, and perfect for family dinners.
    </p>
    <p>
        This dish is versatile too- you can make it with beef, pork, or even vegetables
        for a lighter twist. No matter the version, lasagna is always a warm and
        satisfying favorite.

    <h2>Cooking steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Cook the lasagna sheets according to the package instructions, then drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and garlic, and sauté until
                translucent.</li>
            <li>Add ground beef (or sausage) to the skillet and cook until browned. Season with salt, pepper, and a
                pinch of fresh herbs.</li>
            <li>Pour in tomato sauce and simmer for 10-15 minutes to let the flavors combine.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, mix ricotta cheese with a bit of salt, pepper, and some chopped parsley or basil.
            </li>
            <li>In a baking dish, start layering: spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom, then a layer of
                lasagna sheets, followed by ricotta mixture, and sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers
                until all ingredients are used, finishing with cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional
                15-20 minutes, until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
