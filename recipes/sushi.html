    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that combines perfectly seasoned rice with fresh fish, seafood, and
        vegetables.
        It's an artful balance of flavors and textures, from the tender rice to the crisp vegetables and delicate fish.
        Sushi can be simple or elaborate, making it perfect for both casual meals and special occasions.

        dining experience. Homemade sushi is not only delicious but also a fun and rewarding culinary adventure.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sushi rice</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Nori sheets (seaweed)</li>
        <li>Fresh fish (e.g., salmon, tuna) or cooked seafood</li>
        <li>Cucumber, avocado, and other vegetables</li>
        <li>Soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi for serving</li>
        <li>Bamboo sushi mat (for rolling)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Cook the rice with 2 1/2 cups water in a rice cooker or on the stovetop until tender.</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked rice to a large bowl and gently fold in the vinegar mixture. Let it cool to room
            temperature.</li>
        <li>Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo mat, shiny side down.</li>
        <li>With wet hands, spread a thin layer of rice evenly over the nori, leaving about 1 inch at the top edge.</li>
        <li>Arrange fish and vegetables in a line along the bottom edge of the rice.</li>
        <li>Using the bamboo mat, carefully roll the sushi away from you, pressing gently to shape it into a tight
            cylinder.</li>
        <li>Use a sharp knife to slice the roll into bite-sized pieces. Wetting the knife helps prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Serve sushi with soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi on the side.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Enjoy your homemade sushi!</h3>
